# A* Pathfinding with Tkinter Visualization

## Problem Statement
This program implements the **A\*** pathfinding algorithm to find the shortest path in a grid environment where:
- **1** represents traversable land, and  
- **0** represents blocked areas (river).  

It also provides a **Tkinter-based GUI visualization** to animate the pathfinding process step by step.

---

## Approach
1. **Grid Representation**:  
   - Input grid is represented as a 2D list where cells are either land (1) or river (0).
2. **A\* Algorithm**:  
   - Uses a priority queue (`heapq`) to explore paths based on `f = g + h`,  
     where:
     - \( g \) = cost from start to current node  
     - \( h \) = Euclidean distance heuristic from current node to goal  
3. **Moves Allowed**:  
   - 8 directions (up, down, left, right, and 4 diagonals).  
   - Cost = 1 for straight moves, 1.5 for diagonal moves.
4. **Visualization**:  
   - Tkinter draws the grid.  
   - Start = Yellow (S), Goal = Red (E), Path = Green, Obstacles = Blue.  
   - The path is animated cell by cell with a short delay.

---

## Implementation Details
- **`a_star`**:  
  - Implements A\* algorithm with Euclidean distance heuristic.  
  - Returns the path and its cost if found.
- **`heuristic`**:  
  - Computes Euclidean distance between two grid points.  
- **`visualize`**:  
  - Uses Tkinter to display the grid and animate the discovered path.  
- **`main`**:  
  - Takes user input for grid, start, and goal.  
  - Calls `a_star` and visualizes the result.

## Time Complexity
- **Worst case**: \( O(E \log V) \)  
  where:  
  - \( V \) = number of vertices (grid cells)  
  - \( E \) = number of edges (possible moves).  
- In an \( n \times m \) grid:  
  - \( V = n \cdot m \)  
  - Each node has up to 8 neighbors, so \( E = O(8nm) \).  

**Overall**: \( O(nm \log(nm)) \).

## Space Complexity
- **O(nm)** (for visited set, priority queue, and path storage).

---

## Use Cases
- Maze solving and pathfinding in games.  
- Robotics (finding optimal movement paths).  
- GIS and navigation systems (shortest path on a map).  
- Educational demonstrations of A\* search.

---

## Limitations
- **Blocked Paths**: If the start and goal are disconnected, no solution exists.  
- **Performance**: For very large grids, performance and memory usage may become heavy.  
- **Heuristic**: Uses Euclidean distance, which may not always yield the most efficient expansions compared to Manhattan distance (if only 4-direction moves are allowed).  
- **Tkinter Animation**: Slows down visualization for large grids due to per-step rendering.
