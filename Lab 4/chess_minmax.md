# Chess AI with Minimax (Python)

## Problem Statement
This project implements a **Chess game AI** using the **Minimax algorithm**.  
- The AI evaluates moves by looking ahead a few turns (default search depth = 3).  
- The human player can choose to play as **White (first)** or **Black (second)**.  
- The AI plays legal moves only and tries to maximize its advantage.  

---

## Approach
1. **Board Representation**:  
   - Uses the [`python-chess`](https://pypi.org/project/chess/) library for board setup, move generation, and game rules.  

2. **Evaluation Function**:  
   - Assigns material values to pieces:  
     - Pawn = 1  
     - Knight = 3  
     - Bishop = 3  
     - Rook = 5  
     - Queen = 9  
     - King = 0 (not scored, since losing the king ends the game)  
   - Score = (White material − Black material).  
   - Special handling:  
     - **Checkmate**: ±9999  
     - **Stalemate / Insufficient Material**: 0  

3. **Minimax Algorithm**:  
   - Explores all legal moves up to a given depth.  
   - **Maximizing Player**: AI, tries to maximize score.  
   - **Minimizing Player**: Opponent, tries to minimize score.  

4. **Best Move Selection**:  
   - Iterates over all possible moves for AI.  
   - Chooses the move with the highest evaluation after running Minimax.  

5. **Game Loop**:  
   - Human player makes moves in **UCI format** (e.g., `e2e4`).  
   - AI responds with its calculated best move.  
   - Game continues until **checkmate, stalemate, or draw**.  

---

## Implementation Details
- **`evaluate_board(board)`** → Evaluates board based on material balance and endgame conditions.  
- **`minimax(board, depth, maximizing)`** → Recursively explores possible future moves.  
- **`find_best_move(board, depth)`** → Finds the AI’s best move using Minimax.  
- **`play_game()`** → Handles the interactive game loop with user input and AI responses.

## Time Complexity
- Minimax explores **O(b^d)** states:  
  - b = branching factor (~35 average legal moves in chess).  
  - d = search depth (default = 3).  
- Worst-case: **O(35^3) ≈ 42,875 evaluations**.  

## Space Complexity
- **O(d)** recursion depth (stack).  
- Board state handled by `python-chess`.  

---

## Use Cases
- Demonstrates **AI decision-making in board games**.  
- Educational tool for **game theory, recursion, and adversarial search**.  
- Can be extended with **Alpha-Beta pruning, heuristics, and deeper searches**.  

---

## Limitations
- **No Alpha-Beta pruning** → AI explores all moves, making it slow at higher depths.  
- **Evaluation function is simple** → Only counts material, ignores positioning, pawn structure, king safety, etc.  
- **Limited depth (3 by default)** → Cannot see far-ahead tactics or strategies.
