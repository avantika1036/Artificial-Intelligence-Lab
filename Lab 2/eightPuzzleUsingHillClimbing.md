# 8-Puzzle Solver using Hill Climbing

## Problem Statement
This program solves the 8-puzzle problem using the **Hill Climbing** search algorithm with the **misplaced tiles heuristic**.  
The algorithm starts from an initial configuration and repeatedly moves to a neighbor with a lower heuristic value, stopping when no improvement is possible.

---

## Approach
1. **Representation**:  
   - The puzzle is stored as a 3×3 matrix, with `0` representing the empty space.
2. **Heuristic Function**:  
   - Counts the number of tiles not in their correct position (ignores the empty tile).
3. **Hill Climbing Search**:  
   - At each step, evaluates all possible moves of the empty tile.
   - Selects the neighbor with the smallest heuristic value.
4. **Termination Conditions**:  
   - Goal state reached.
   - No neighbor has a lower heuristic value (local maximum/plateau).

---

## Implementation Details
- **`print_board`**: Prints the current puzzle board state.
- **`isGoal`**: Checks if the current state matches the goal state.
- **`findEmptyBox`**: Finds coordinates of the empty tile (`0`).
- **`misplaced_tiles`**: Calculates heuristic (number of misplaced tiles).
- **`get_neighbors`**: Generates all possible states by moving the empty tile in up to 4 directions.
- **`hillClimbing`**:
  - Keeps track of the current state and its heuristic.
  - Selects the neighbor with the lowest heuristic.
  - Stops if no improvement is possible.
- **`main`**:
  - Defines start and goal states.
  - Calls `hillClimbing` to solve the puzzle.

## Time Complexity
- **Worst case**: \( O(b \times d) \)  
  where:
  - \( b \) = branching factor (up to 4 moves)  
  - \( d \) = number of steps taken until termination.
- Typically fast but may terminate prematurely.

## Space Complexity
- **O(1)** additional space (only current state and neighbors stored at each step).

---

## Use Cases
- Demonstrating the limitations of local search algorithms.
- Educational purposes for AI search methods.
- Comparing performance with other heuristics (e.g., Manhattan distance).

---

## Limitations
- **Local Optima**: Can get stuck in a local minimum.
- **Plateaus**: May stop if all neighbors have equal heuristic values.
- **No Backtracking**: Once stuck, it does not explore alternative paths.
- **Not Optimal**: May find a solution that is not the shortest.
