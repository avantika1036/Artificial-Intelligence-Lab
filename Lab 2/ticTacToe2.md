# Tic-Tac-Toe with Magic Square Logic AI

## Problem Statement

Implement a **Tic-Tac-Toe** game where a human player competes against an AI opponent that leverages the mathematical properties of a **magic square** to make strategic decisions.  
The board is a 3x3 grid numbered 1 to 9, with each position mapped to a unique number in a magic square.  
The AI uses sums of 15 (a key property of the magic square) to detect winning moves and block the opponent effectively.  
The AI can play either as **X** (going first) or **O** (going second), based on user choice.

---

## Approach

- Represent the Tic-Tac-Toe board as a vector of size 10 (indexing positions 1 to 9 for convenience).  
- Each board position can hold:
  - `2` for empty,
  - `3` for X,
  - `5` for O.
- Use a predefined **magic square mapping** array to translate board positions to magic numbers:
    - Position: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
    - Magic #: 8, 3, 4, 1, 5, 9, 6, 7, 2


- Track player moves by storing their chosen magic numbers.
- Detect possible winning or blocking moves by checking pairs of moves whose sums with a missing third number equal 15.
- On each AI turn:
- Try to win if possible.
- Block the opponent's winning move.
- Otherwise, choose the first available empty position.
- Determine the winner by checking if any combination of three magic numbers sums exactly to 15.

## Implementation Details

- **Board Representation:**  
A `vector<int>` of size 10, where indices 1 through 9 correspond to the board cells. Each cell holds 2 (empty), 3 (X), or 5 (O).

- **Magic Square Mapping:**  
`magicMap[10] = {0, 8, 3, 4, 1, 5, 9, 6, 7, 2};`  
Maps board indices to their magic square numbers.

- **Move Processing:**  
- `Go(int n)`: Marks the move at position `n` if empty and increments turn count.
- `getPlayerMoves(int player)`: Returns a vector of magic numbers for all positions occupied by the given player.
- `possWinMagic(int player)`: Checks if the player can win in the next move by looking for pairs summing to 15 minus the needed number; returns winning move position or 0 if none.
- `checkWinner()`: Checks if either player has a winning triple summing to 15.

- **Human Input:**  
Prompts for move until a valid, empty position is chosen.

- **AI Logic:**  
Uses magic square sums to find winning/blocking moves; otherwise, picks the first available spot.

- **Game Loop:**  
Alternates between AI and human moves, printing the board and checking for winners or draw.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(1) per move  
The AI and winner checks perform fixed operations over a small, constant-sized board and precomputed combinations.

- **Space Complexity:** O(1)  
Uses a fixed-size vector and arrays; no dynamic memory grows with input size.

## Use Cases

- Play Tic-Tac-Toe against an AI that uses mathematical properties (magic squares) to make optimal moves.
- Demonstrate how magic squares can simplify game logic and win detection.
- Educational example of integrating mathematical concepts into game AI.
- Foundation for expanding to more complex game AI or incorporating alternative board evaluation techniques.
